        <h2 class="aboutSectionHeader">Meet Matthew Brown</h2>
        <p>
          Matt was born in the great state of South Carolina. Around the age of
          5, Matt's family moved to a small town in Kentucky called London. It
          was here that Matt went through the only official, accredited
          school(s) that he'd ever attend. After finishing school, Matt found
          himself working various jobs until he and his family decided to move
          back to South Carolina. In South Carolina, Matt attempted to pursue a
          career in vocational Christian ministry by attending a leadership
          program at a mega church in Anderson, South Carolina.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon completion of this program, Matt began to realize that maybe
          vocational ministry wasn't the path that he wanted to take. He began
          working, instead, in Supply Chain at Wabtec Coorporation in Duncan,
          South Carolina. After being there for a year, Matt received an offer
          to work in Supply Chain at a security company called CPI Security
          where he works today.

          To take a bit of a rabbit trail that will help us get to where Matt
          is, let's discuss a hobby that he's participated in and have enjoyed
          since childhood; and that hobby is video games. Matt has been an avid
          gamer for the majority of his life. In 2020, Matt began playing lots
          of Grand Theft Auto Roleplay, through FiveM. In his first server, he
          met a lot of friends, one of which turned out to be an experienced
          software engineer. After leaving the server that they both were at for
          quite some time, Matt's software enginner friend ventured off to start
          his own server. Matt started by helping with testing and trying to
          find bugs with the server while helping set up a lot of immersive
          stuff for the game's players/characters. After server launch, Matt
          joined the admin team and ultimately the dev team where his software
          engineer friend would begin showing him lots of software stuff with
          the programming language Lua. Most of what Matt did was
          configurations, but that birthed a passion in coding that he never
          really knew that he had.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fast forward to today, Matt has been enrolled in a program called
          CourseCareers which has been teaching him the ins and outs to coding
          to ultimately land him a job within software development. This website
          actually serves as his first project of many within the software
          world.
